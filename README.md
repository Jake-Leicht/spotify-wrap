# Spotify Wrap

The project uses the Spotify API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to pull user data from their account and provide them with a personal breakdown of their listening habits (similar to Spotify's yearly wrap). Listing user's most listened to songs, top artists, favorite genres, etc.
